# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

- **Repository**: `-`
- **Status**: Newly initialized — no source code, build system, or dependencies configured yet
- **Owner**: hasegawa212

## Repository Structure

```
/
├── README.md       # Project readme (placeholder)
└── CLAUDE.md       # This file — AI assistant guide
```

This is an empty repository with only the initial commit. All project structure, tooling, and conventions will be established as development begins.

## Development Environment

- **Platform**: Linux
- **Git remote**: origin (GitHub via hasegawa212)

### Prerequisites

None configured yet. Update this section as the tech stack is chosen.

## Build & Run Commands

No build system is configured. Update this section when a package manager and build tooling are added.

<!-- Example (uncomment and update when applicable):
### Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### Build
```sh
npm run build
```

### Run tests
```sh
npm test
```

### Lint
```sh
npm run lint
```
-->

## Code Conventions

No conventions established yet. Document them here as the project takes shape. Consider:

- Language and framework choices
- Module system (ESM vs CJS)
- Formatting and linting rules
- Naming conventions (files, variables, components)
- Directory layout patterns
- Testing strategy and coverage expectations
- Commit message format

## Key Patterns & Architecture

To be defined. When architectural decisions are made, document them here so AI assistants can follow consistent patterns.

## Things to Watch Out For

- This repo name is a single dash (`-`), which can conflict with CLI tools that interpret `-` as stdin/stdout. Use explicit paths when referencing this repo in scripts.

## Updating This File

Keep CLAUDE.md up to date as the project evolves:

1. Add build/test/lint commands as tooling is introduced
2. Document code conventions when style guides are adopted
3. Record architectural decisions and key patterns
4. Note any non-obvious project-specific gotchas
